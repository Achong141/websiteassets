            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, and welcome to my website. As you may already know, my name is Andrew and I am currently a freshman architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Architecture. This website will be continuously updated to showcase the work I've done throughout my time in college, so stick around for future projects! 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: .5em">
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things to know about me: I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Favorite hobbies and activities include working out extensively, eating as much food as I want because I work out so often, oil/acrylic painting, doing quick sketches of interesting or funny things, listening to music (I'll listen to just about anything), watching films and animations, exploring art galleries or museums, traveling around a city and sightseeing, and sleeping after pulling an all nighter.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: .5em">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any questions or want to reach out to me, feel free to contact me via email or phone (information on the resume to the right).
